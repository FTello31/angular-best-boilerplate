# Angular Best Boilerplate

This project is created for Angular 8+.

_...To Not Reinvent The Wheel Again_.

**_Work in progress_**.

## General concept

Always keep order so that your project does not become another legacy monster from which you will want to escape ASAP.

The directories you always need:
1. App.
2. Environments.
3. Assets.
4. Test.
5. Lib.
6. Styles.
7. Translations.

## Application concept

The directories you always need:
